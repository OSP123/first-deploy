    <h1>Something Random</h1>
    <p>There once was a boy who dreamed of going to space. He plowed the fields and tilled all day, but his dreams were in the stars.</p>
    <p>One day, while he was hard at work on his family's farm, he saw a large spaceship flying overhead. It was so close, he could almost smell the jet fuel.</p>
